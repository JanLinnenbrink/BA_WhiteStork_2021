# BA_WhiteStork_2021

Using monthly SDMs, the current potential and realized distribution of the white stork is analysed and hypothesis of future changes in its distribution are presented. 
Therefore, remotely sensed data is acquired and processed. Telemetry data is obtained from the Movebank-database and environmental data is obtained from various sources (e.g., from the WorldClim-database). Using telemetry data enables modelling the white stork distribution on the individual and on the population level. The models are based on the maximum entropy algorithm Maxent and limited to the wintering grounds of the white stork in Africa, which are located in the eastern Sahelian zone.Using monthly SDMs, the current potential and realized distribution of the white stork is analysed and hypothesis of future changes in its distribution are presented.
